============================

This is the code for the website http://alq.org.au

# Installation

To install, check out create_site.sh in the scripts directory.  Comments in the header should explain things.

I'm thinking about making a docker image to do it all

# Testing

To run the tests:
 * Install NPM
 * Download the latest selenium to test/lib (update it in run-tests.sh if there is a later version)
 * In the test directory run npm 'install'
 * In the test directory run npm './run-tests.sh'
 * Stand back and be amazed
