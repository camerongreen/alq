<p>Articles are used for things that change, like news, an action we'd like users to take for a current issue etc, rather than more information heavy, long term or structural pages of the site.  They will not appear in the site navigation menus.</p>
<p>To create an article :</p>
<ul>
  <li>Go to admin toolbar -> Content -> Add Content -> Article</li>
</ul>
